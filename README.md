# rs2006sp-Online
Nulled rs2006sp server for Hamachi/Online

Only the server host needs this modified file.

If you are going to use Hamachi have everyone set the adapter priority to 1.

Modifications:

The rs2006sp Server.jar has a check to see if you are connecting from Localhost, a 192.168.X.X subet or a 10.X.X.X subnet

You can perform the same bytecode edits yourself with Recaf (https://github.com/Col-E/Recaf) on line 3025 of com/rs2/model/d/g in Server.jar

Just replace Server.jar in your folder with this. Tell your friends to join your Hamachi network and change their adapter priority. Scan and connect!
